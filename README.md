## Rule
When the time counts down to 0, the grenade would explode and result in the failure of the explosion side player. Players can move their 
shields vertically to deflect the grenade and let the grenade hit the randomly generated props 
to trigger some specific effects. When player fail to catch the grenade, the timer will deduct 3 seconds.
